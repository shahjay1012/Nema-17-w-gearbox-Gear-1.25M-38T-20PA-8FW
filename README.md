# NEMA 17 Gear â€“ 1.25M 38T 20PA 8FW

![Gear Preview](Gear.png)

## Overview
This CAD model represents a **38-tooth spur gear** designed for a **NEMA 17 stepper motor gearbox** used in robotic conveyor actuation systems. The design follows a **1.25 module, 20Â° pressure angle**, and **8mm face width (FW)** standard. It is optimized for smooth torque transmission in lightweight conveyor and pick-and-place robotic assemblies.

## Purpose and Application
This gear is part of the **motion-transfer subsystem** for predictive conveyor control experiments. It was developed to support **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** research in robotic food automation, where precise synchronization between conveyor motion and robotic actuation is required.  

By minimizing backlash and maintaining consistent load transfer, this gear ensures stable performance during high-frequency acceleration and deceleration cycles typical in robotic food handling.
